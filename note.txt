node_modules/: This folder contains all the dependencies installed for our project using npm.

public/: The public directory is used to store static assets like images, fonts, and favicon. Files placed here can be referenced directly from the HTML or other components.

src/: This is where most of your project's code will go. It contains subdirectories for different types of code:

components/: This folder can hold React components that are shared across different pages or sections of your app.

pages/: Next.js uses the pages directory to define routes for your application. Each JavaScript file in this directory becomes a route. For example, index.js corresponds to the root URL ("/"), and about.js would correspond to "/about".

styles/: This directory is used to store your CSS styles. globals.css can be used for global styles, and .module.css files are used for local CSS modules.

.gitignore: A file that lists files and directories to be ignored by version control (Git). This prevents unnecessary files from being committed to your repository, such as the node_modules folder and build artifacts.

package.json: This file contains metadata about your project and its dependencies. We can also define scripts to run various commands.

README.md: A markdown file that typically provides an introduction to your project, instructions for installation, and other important information.
